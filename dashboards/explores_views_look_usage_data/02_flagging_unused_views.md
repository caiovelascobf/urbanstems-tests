# üß± Looker View Deprecation Analysis ‚Äî Step-by-Step Guide

This guide explains how to identify **unused Looker views** in your LookML project, so they can be safely removed or deprecated. Views define the dimensions and measures that power dashboards, explores, and ad hoc queries ‚Äî but unused views add complexity and technical debt.

This analysis combines:
- **Explore-based usage** from your LookML models
- **Real-world query usage** from Looker‚Äôs System Activity logs

## üéØ Why This Matters in the Deprecation Workflow

In Looker:
- **Views** are data blueprints
- **Explores** are user entry points
- **Dashboards/Looks** rely on explores, which in turn reference views

That means:
- If a view is **not referenced by any explore**, and
- **Not used in any actual query** (SQL Runner, dev explores, dashboard filters)...

üëâ It is **safe to deprecate**.

> ‚úÖ Deprecating unused views will:
> - Remove technical clutter
> - Prevent confusion and misused fields
> - Improve model performance and validation times
> - Reduce maintenance cost

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Extract View and Explore Metadata

**üìÑ Source File:** `script_01-extracting_looker_tables_from_views_and_models.csv`

This file is generated from `.view.lkml` and `.model.lkml` files, and includes:
- View names and file paths
- Explore definitions, including `from:` references and base view overrides
- Join view aliases and their resolved `from:` views
- `${other_view.field}` field-level cross references
- Derived table upstream sources parsed from `derived_table.sql`

> ‚öôÔ∏è You already created this using `script_01`, which parses your LookML project recursively and generates a fully deduplicated map of dependencies.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Gather System Activity (Real Query Usage)

**üìÑ Source File:** `system__activity_history_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`  
Exported from **System Activity ‚Üí History** in Looker.

This file includes:
- `Query Fields Used`: actual fields used in any Looker query
- `Query Created Date`: when the query was run
- Used to detect views even if they're **not modeled in explores**

> This step helps catch edge cases like:
> - SQL Runner queries
> - Dev-mode explores
> - Scheduled content based on legacy views

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Flag Unused Views

**üìú Script:** `script_03-flag_unused_views.py`  
**üìÑ Output:** `script_03-flag_unused_views.csv`

This script combines both input files and produces a comprehensive view usage audit.

### üß† Key Fields in the Output:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `view_name` | Name of the LookML view |
| `lkml_file` | Path to the `.view.lkml` file |
| `sql_table_names` | Table name if the view uses `sql_table_name` |
| `derived_table_sources` | Source tables used in `derived_table.sql`, if present |
| `used_in_explore` | `True` if referenced in a model explore (via `from:`, `view_name:`, `join:`, `${view.field}`, or derived table SQL) |
| `used_in_system_activity` | `True` if queried in actual Looker usage (System Activity) |
| `last_used_in_system_activity` | Most recent date the view was queried (empty if never) |
| `safe_to_deprecate_view` | `True` if the view is unused in both LookML *and* live queries |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Logic Summary

```text
1. Load all views defined in .view.lkml files

2. Identify view references in:
    a. base_view_name of explores (via view_name: or from:)
    b. join aliases resolved to view names (join: xyz { from: abc })
    c. ${other_view.field} references across LookML files
    d. derived_table.sql blocks that use FROM or JOIN view.table patterns

3. Load query history from System Activity CSV:
    a. Parse view names from "Query Fields Used"
    b. Track most recent usage date per view

4. For each view:
    - Flag used_in_explore based on step 2 references
    - Flag used_in_system_activity based on step 3 query history
    - If both are False ‚Üí safe_to_deprecate_view = True

5. Output the final audit to script_03-flag_unused_views.csv
