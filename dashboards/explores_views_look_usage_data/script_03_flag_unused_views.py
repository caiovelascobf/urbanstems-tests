"""
Description:
    This script identifies unused Looker views by analyzing which views
    are defined in .view.lkml files but never referenced in any explore.

    It uses the output from the script_01 from scanning looker-master (dashboards\explores_views_data), which contains both:
        - Views from .view.lkml files
        - Explores from .model.lkml files with their referenced views

    The result is a list of views with a flag indicating whether they are used,
    and if so, which explores reference them.

Input:
    - script_01-extracting_looker_tables_from_views_and_models.csv

Output:
    - script_03-flag_unused_views.csv
