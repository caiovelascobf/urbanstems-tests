-- LINEAGE - TRACKING AN ORDER

-- SUMMARY -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1) HEVO OMS SUBORDERS -> dynamodb_test_schema.hevo_oms_suborders -> STG_SUBORDERS
-- -- suborder-level data ingested from the OMS source, including delivery details, recipient information, and identifiers (order_id, suborder_id)

-- 2) HEVO OMS ORDERS -> dynamodb_test_schema.hevo_oms_orders -> STG_ORDERS
-- -- order-level data ingested from the OMS source, including: subscription data and core identifiers (order_id, user_id)

-- 3) HEVO OMS TRANSACTIONS -> dynamodb_test_schema.hevo_oms_prod_transactions -> STG_TRANSACTIONS
-- -- transaction-level data ingested from the OMS source, including: payment data and core identifiers (order_id, tran_id)

-- 4) SHOPIFY TRANSACTIONS -> dynamodb_test_schema.shopify_order_transactions + STG_TRANSACTIONS -> STG_SHOP_TRANSACTIONS
-- -- transaction-level data ingested from both OMS and SHOPIFY transactions via UNION ALL: payment data and core identifiers (order_id, tran_id)

-- 5) STG_TRANSACTIONS -> OMS_REFUNDS
-- -- refunded-order-level data â€” one row per refunded order.
-- -- Extracts total refund amount, timestamp, and refund reasons for each order from raw transaction-level data (hevo_oms_prod_transactions).
-- -- Although tran_id is used to deduplicate transactions earlier in the pipeline, the aggregations (SUM, MIN, LISTAGG) are all done by order_id.

-- 6) HEVO OMS LINE ITEMS -> dynamodb_test_schema.hevo_oms_prod_lineitems -> STG_LINE_ITEMS
-- -- item-level detail within each suborder (SKU, name, quantity, and unit pricing)

-- 7) HEVO OMS LINE ITEMS -> dynamodb_test_schema.hevo_oms_prod_salelineitems -> STG_SPLIT_LINE_ITEMS
